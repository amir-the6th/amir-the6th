> “When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,
> When the road you’re trudging seems all uphill,

> And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,
> When care is pressing you down a bit,
> Rest, if you must, but don’t you quit.

> Life is queer with its twists and turns,
> As every one of us sometimes learns,
> And many a failure turns about,
> When he might have won had he stuck it out;
> Don’t give up though the pace seems slow-  
> You may succeed with another blow.  
> 
> Often the goal is nearer than,  
> It seems to a faint and faltering man,  
> Often the struggler has given up,  
> When he might have captured the victor’s cup,  
> And he learned too late when the night slipped down,  
> How close he was to the golden crown.  
> 
> Success is failure turned inside out-  
> The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,  
> And you never can tell how close you are,  
> It may be near when it seems so far,  
> So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit-  
> It’s when things seem worst that you must not quit”
