## Motivational Poem

<details>
  
<summary>Open Dropdown</summary>
<br>

***Don't Quit!***
<br>
<cite>by: *Edgar Albert Guest*</cite>
  
> “When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,<br/>
> When the road you’re trudging seems all uphill,<br/>
> When the funds are low and the debts are high,<br/>
> And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,<br/>
> When care is pressing you down a bit,<br/>
> Rest, if you must, but don’t you quit.<br/>
> 
> Life is queer with its twists and turns,<br/>
> As every one of us sometimes learns,<br/>
> And many a failure turns about,<br/>
> When he might have won had he stuck it out;<br/>
> Don’t give up though the pace seems slow-<br/>
> You may succeed with another blow.<br/>
> 
> Often the goal is nearer than,<br/>
> It seems to a faint and faltering man,<br/>
> Often the struggler has given up,<br/>
> When he might have captured the victor’s cup,<br/>
> And he learned too late when the night slipped down,<br/>
> How close he was to the golden crown.<br/>
> 
> Success is failure turned inside out-<br/>
> The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,<br/>
> And you never can tell how close you are,<br/>
> It may be near when it seems so far,<br/>
> So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit-<br/>
> It’s when things seem worst that you must not quit”<br/>
